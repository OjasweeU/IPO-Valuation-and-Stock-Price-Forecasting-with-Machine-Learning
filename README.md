## Pipeline Overview

The project follows a structured data science pipeline:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Initial data loading and exploration to understand the structure and characteristics of the datasets.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and outlier detection.
3. **Data Transformation**: Applying standardization and normalization techniques.
4. **Correlation and Feature Selection**: Analyzing feature correlations and selecting the most relevant features.
5. **Model Building**: Implementing and evaluating Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, LSTM, and ARIMA models.
6. **Results and Recommendations**: Summarizing model performance and providing actionable recommendations.

## Data Dictionary

The datasets include historical stock price data for each company, with the following key columns:

- `Date`: The trading date.
- `Open`: The opening price of the stock.
- `High`: The highest price of the stock during the trading session.
- `Low`: The lowest price of the stock during the trading session.
- `Close`: The closing price of the stock.
- `Adj Close`: The adjusted closing price, accounting for dividends and splits.
- `Volume`: The number of shares traded.

## Identifying Null Values, Descriptive Statistics

The project identifies and handles missing values and calculates descriptive statistics to understand the distribution and characteristics of the data.

## Encoding and Imputation

Handles missing data using forward fill imputation, ensuring that no gaps affect the model training process.

## Feature Engineering

Features such as moving averages, daily returns, and volatility are engineered to capture key patterns in the data that influence stock price movements.

## Outlier Detection (IQR)

Outliers are detected using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method, which helps in identifying and potentially excluding anomalous data points.

## Standardization (Min-Max)

The data is standardized using Min-Max scaling to bring all features into the same range, improving the performance of machine learning models.

## Normalization

Normalization using z-scores is applied to align the data distribution more closely with a standard normal distribution.

## Data Merge

Relevant datasets are merged based on the `Date` column, enabling a holistic analysis across multiple companies.

## Correlation Analysis

Correlation analysis is performed to identify relationships between features, helping in feature selection and model interpretation.

## Feature Selection

Features are selected based on correlation thresholds, ensuring that only the most relevant variables are used in the modeling process.

## Modeling

The project employs four key models:

1. **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**: Used for regression tasks with high-dimensional feature spaces.
2. **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees for robust predictions.
3. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: A type of neural network designed for sequential data like time series.
4. **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: A statistical model used for time series forecasting.

## Results and Recommendations

Model performance is evaluated using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and other relevant metrics. The best-performing model is recommended for future stock price forecasting.
